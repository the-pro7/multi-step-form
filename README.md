## Overview 🌟

### The Challenge 🧪

Users should be able to:

- ❌ Complete each step of the sequence
- ❌ Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- ❌ See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- ❌ View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- ❌ See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- ❌ Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

Still work-in-progress(WIP)
